            <h3>fresh and organic</h3>
            <p>Fresh foods produced using organic farming methods are called Organic foods. These are foods that are free of synthetics such as pesticides and chemical fertilizers, which are commonly used. Organic foods include fresh produce, meats, dairy products, and processed foods such as drinks, frozen meals, etc. Organic foods are processed only using organic methods and not in industries or using genetic engineering techniques.

Even though organic foods are priced higher than conventional foods, organic food has grown significantly since the late 20th century. People tend to disregard the higher price of organic foods for their nutritional benefits. Organic foods also have an environmental benefit as they do not use harmful pesticides and fertilizers to increase their yield.</p>
